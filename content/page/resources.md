Here you can find various resources that I have made available to the
community.  A key principle of our work is that whenever possible, we
make our code and data freely available to the community.  You can
find links to the relevant code/data alongside each paper listed on my
[publications](/page/papers/) page.

In addition to those papers, I highlight some key resources below.

### IntactEye

IntactEye is a program for measuring the location of injection sites
in the intact eye.


### SA3D

### R 

I've written a short article in <a
href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/doi/pcbi.1000482">PLoS Computational
Biology</a> describing my experiences teaching R to graduate students.
Lecture notes (in <a
href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/fetchSingleRepresentation.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000482.s001">PDF</a>)
were provided as supplementary information.  Together with my
colleague [Laurent Gatto](http://cpu.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/), we have updated the [material](https://github.com/lgatto/spr).


I develop and maintain [several R packages](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/r) for
my research.  The most popular package is probably [sjemea](http://github.com/sje30/sjemea) for
analysis of multielectrode array data.
