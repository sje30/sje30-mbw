I am a Reader in Computational Neuroscience in the
[Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](http://damtp.cam.ac.uk),
and member of the Cambridge Computational Biology Institute
[CCBI](http://www.ccbi.cam.ac.uk). I use computational techniques to
investigate development of the nervous system.  I am also director of
the
[MPhil in Computational Biology](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mphil/compbio).
