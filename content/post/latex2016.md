Every year I give a one-hour lecture introducting LaTeX to mathematics
undergraduates and Masters students.  After the lecture, I normally
host a lab session for students to work through some material.

# Slides

The
[slides](https://github.com/sje30/latex101/blob/master/latex101.pdf)
for the talk are, of-course, written in LaTeX using the
[Beamer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-beamer/) package.  The
source code for the files are available on
[github](http://github.com/sje30/latex101).  (New for 2016 is that
I've switch to the *sourcesanspro* font.)

# Lab material

I've written a short template file for students to adopt when writing
their own reports.  The main source file is [intro.tex](https://github.com/sje30/texintro/blob/master/intro.tex) and the
corresponding output is [intro.pdf](https://github.com/sje30/texintro/blob/master/intro.pdf).  To recompile the document yourself,
you will need to download the whole directory.  The easiest way to do
this is to do:

    git clone https://github.com/sje30/texintro
